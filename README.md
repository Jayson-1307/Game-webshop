## Introduction
This project is a sleek, responsive e-commerce site built for selling interactive text adventure games. It leverages modern web technologies like TypeScript for coding, Express.js for backend services, and Lit for crafting reusable web components, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. The purpose is to create an effortless way for users to discover, browse, and purchase games, featuring options such as detailed game descriptions, a shopping cart, and a checkout process.

The project illustrates strong full-stack development abilities, with an emphasis on creating a modular and scalable structure, along with efficient API route management.
